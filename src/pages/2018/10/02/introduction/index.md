## A warm welcome to everybody! My blog just spawned!

<p style = "line-height: 1.5;">With these words I just want to say "Hey!" and within that, I want to introduce myself to you as my readers. So in case you haven't noticed, my name is Daniel Uhlmann and I work as a system engineer/DevOps engineer. Some of our core technologies here are Ansible, Jenkins, Git or Docker for example. When I'm not at work and dealing with customer requests, I like to program my own projects at home or try to give something back to the OpenSource community. So I am interested in a wide range of topics, but I feel most comfortable in the web development thingy, like playing around with JavaScript <br>(yes including frameworks), or try to get a grasp out of some technologies, which are more famous for the backend, such as PHP or MySQL.</p>
<br></br>

## Okay... I think you are a nice person, but what can I expect here?

<p style = "line-height: 1.5;">Well, this question is a valid one. Hang on a second and I might tell you the secret you desire (yes I know, I'm a funny one). So if we leave all the jokes aside, I can tell you with a clear conscience that the main part of this blog is about technical topics. Of course, this also includes my personal knowledge gained over the time or interesting features of technologies.</p>

<br></br>
## That sounds like something I want to read about!

<p style = "line-height: 1.5;">Wohoo! So I've achieved my primary goal. If you still don't know if this blog could become your favorite blog, I would recommend you to read the next 2-3 posts and decide afterward.</p>
