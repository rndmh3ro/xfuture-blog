So lately I thought about stand-up's and what bothers me about them. I found a few points that are in some ways not that optimal as I wish they would. This made me look for opportunities to optimize the process in some situations. Furthermore, if you as a reader are already doing stand-up's with your team then please always remember that bad stand-up's are better than none at all.

##What most people are used to and why it can be suboptimal
