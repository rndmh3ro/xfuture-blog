So lately I thought about stand-up's and what bothers me about them. I found a few points that are in some ways not that optimal as I wish they would. This made me look for opportunities to optimize the process in some situations. Furthermore, if you as a reader are already doing stand-up's with your team then please always remember that bad stand-up's are better than none at all.

##What most people are used to and why it can be suboptimal

The most common way to run the stand-up is the "yesterday - today - blockers" modell. So in other words: what did I do yesterday. What will I do today. Is there possibly something that blocks my progress with the work I have to finish. Individually, this doesn't look so bad at first glance. But stand-up's are team events for me. To give you a better understanding of what I am trying to describe here, compare the "yesterday - today - blockers" modell with the example below.

Example: you are in a workshop or business meeting where everyone in the group introduces themselves. Before you have to introduce yourself and tell something about who you are do you listen to the others or are you just working out your story in your head that you want to tell soon? And after it was your turn aren't you relieved and maybe only then listen to what the others say after you?

I think the same thing happens in a lot of stand-ups. Everyone wants to tell a good story and make a good impression. This distracts you and you don't listen to others even if it might be important.

##Sounds logical but is there another way?
