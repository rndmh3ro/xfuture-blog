##Have you ever wondered why a colleague of yours is annoyed or burnt out?

<p style = "line-height: 1.5;">
Have you ever had a conversation with a colleague where he got upset about the current situation in the project? Or do you even know colleagues who seem completely burnt out and therefore often only see negative things in the current situation? Well, anyone can behave like this once in a while. But why is that the case? Does this behavior only come from stress and huge loads of tasks, or are there other factors that can lead to such a behavior? <br></br></p>

##I think there are other factors that can affect this

<p style = "line-height: 1.5;">
In the next few lines I want to take a look at some possible factors. Of course, one of the better known problems is the huge stack of tasks that never seems to shrink. But besides this problem, which is probably a general problem in office jobs, there are also problems that seem more IT specific to me. For example, take a look at developers fighting with their managers, because they plan milestones for a project far away from any realistic time estimation. Or look at how often sustainable work is not possible, because you have to rush for best practices to reach the original deadlines.
