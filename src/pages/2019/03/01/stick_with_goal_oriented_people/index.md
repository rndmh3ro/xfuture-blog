##Why I come up with such a topic

<p style = "line-height: 1.5;">
Not so long ago I've read an article about people who radically cleaned their surroundings of pessimistic people. The reason for this action was their own attitude, namely that you are only as successful as the people you have to deal with every day. This post has raised my interest and so I've started to think a bit about this topic for myself.

##"You are only as successful as those you frequently associate with."

So successful people are always on the hunt for individuals wo are goal-oriented, enthusiastic, optimistic and who have an overall positive mental outlook. So that means that some people made a habit out of associating with other success-minded individuals. And on the flip side, they also make a point to limit their exposure to negative and toxic people. So for successful people it's important to kinda replace negative friends and search out for positive individuals because they are very positive by their own and they want to get the same thing back for themselves. So as a result, most successful people made a habit out of associating with other success-minded individuals and on the flip side, they also make a point to limit their exposure to negative and toxic people.

##So we emulate the people we associate with?

They say that you are the average of the 5 people you spend the most time with. But is this true? When it comes down to relationships, we are highly influenced by those closest to us. This affects our way of thinking, our self-esteem and our general decisions. And you know what? I can relate to this statement. Surely we are our own person, but we're more affected by our environment than we think.
