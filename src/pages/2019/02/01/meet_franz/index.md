##The initial situation which is bad for us

<p style = "line-height: 1.5;">
So imagine this: You want to use your laptop for the most time of your day instead of your phone and you need to use WhatsApp because you want to stay in contact with your family, Telegram because your friends using this messenger, Slack or RocketChat for example because you need to communicate with your colleagues and of course your googlemail account to check all your emails in time. If you increment this to your own real world scenario you will end up with like 4-5 different messengers and news related applications. And now we have reached a point where we can say that this is not really handy or productive.<br></br></p>
