##My intention behind this post

<p style = "line-height: 1.5;">
My idea behind this post is to perhaps give you a push to think about this topic. Besides that, I can give you some thoughts as a junior developer and how I perceive this case. So if you are a senior developer and you need to guide your youngster through your projects or code, this may help you a bit to separate the good from the bad. You can even read this post if you are not that experienced.<br></br></p>

##You join a new team and get a bunch of code from your colleagues

<p style = "line-height: 1.5;">
Back in the days this headline would have given me the first little panic attack. But now you are here... in front of your monitor and you read all the code and try to understand what's happening there. After some time you've spend with the code, you still got no clue. I guess this situation would look familiar to everyone who has been in this specific situation. And that's not wrong at all.<br></br></p>

##What you can do as a junior to have a better start

<p style = "line-height: 1.5;">

#####<i>Ask questions early!</i>
<p style = "line-height: 1.5;">
Don't wait until you are down the rabbit-hole before you start asking for some help. Part of not asking your questions when you really need to, through fear of appearing like an idiot to your colleagues, is how you end up building the wrong things and write bad code. Asking questions is one of the most important thing that you need to learn in your carreer.
<br></br></p>

#####<i>Don't be afraid to say something in meetings, reviews etc.</i>
<p style = "line-height: 1.5;">
This may sound like a normal thing to you. But have you never had the feeling that you wanted to say something, but you don't because you are afraid that it's wrong? Next time... go for it! The worst thing that can happen to you is that you are wrong.
<br></br></p>

#####<i>Document your code!</i>
<p style = "line-height: 1.5;">
That's right! Your code is not self-documenting. Good comments will help you to spot errors or help other fellows to understand your code snippets.
<br></br></p>

#####<i>Seek constructive criticism.</i> 
<p style = "line-height: 1.5;">
Praise is important to, don't get me wrong. But constructive criticism is also essential to help you to improve as a developer. The criticism can help you to identify your problems and to improve your code, documentation, behavior in some cases. A good way for this is a team meeting or even the comments in your merge requests.
<br></br></p>

#####<i>Pair program with more experienced colleagues.</i>
<p style = "line-height: 1.5;">
Pair programming or reviewing your code at all can be frustrating. They're most likely faster at writing code, faster at solving problems and faster at identifying the cause of bugs. It can be painful if you still working out all the shortcuts in your IDE while a more senior developer already fixed the problem. Sometimes it will feel more rewarding to solve problems on your own, but you may not learn as much.
<br></br></p>

##Great ideas for junior developers but how can I help them out as a more experienced developer?

<p style = "line-height: 1.5;">
Well this one depends a bit on your own personal favors in my opinion, at least for the explanation part. Maybe you have a good time with your student while you explain him something with practical examples in your already written code, or you feel better if you explain him something oral. In any case keep one simple thing in mind: "Guide those who want to be guided." <br></br></p>

#####<i>Keep your willingness to reiterate and explain the same thing differently without getting annoyed.</i>
<p style = "line-height: 1.5;">
This is a serious thing. Like explaining something for 2 or 3 times and the opposite part won't catch up your thoughts? I bet you've felt that way before. And then you feel a bit annoyed or just dont know how to explain it to your student in any other way. And that's okay. But please don't rage on your junior and please don't call him dumb, or something similar to that.
