##My intention behind this post

<p style = "line-height: 1.5;">
My idea behind this post is to perhaps give you a push to think about this topic. Besides that, I can give you some thoughts as a junior developer and how I perceive this case. So if you are a senior developer and you need to guide your youngster through your projects or code, this may help you a bit to separate the good from the bad. You can even read this post if you are not that experienced.<br></br></p>

##You join a new team and get a bunch of code from your colleagues

Back in the days this headline would have given me the first little panic attack. But now you are here... in front of your monitor and you read all the code and try to understand what's happening there. After some time you've spend with the code, you still got no clue. I guess this situation would look familiar to everyone who has been in this specific situation. And that's not wrong at all.<br></br></p>

##What you can do as a junior to have a better start

<i>Ask questions early!</i> Don't wait until you are down the rabbit-hole before you start asking for some help. Part of not asking your questions when you really need to, through fear of appearing like an idiot to your colleagues, is how you end up building the wrong things and write bad code. Asking questions is one of the most important thing that you need to learn in your carreer.

<i>Don't be afraid to say something in meetings, reviews etc.</i> This may sound like a normal thing to you. But have you never had the feeling that you wanted to say something, but you don't because you are afraid that it's wrong? Next time... go for it! The worst thing that can happen to you is that you are wrong.
